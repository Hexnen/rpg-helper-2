# RPG Helper 2.0 - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
RPG Helper is a comprehensive web application designed to help tabletop RPG players manage their campaigns, characters, and game sessions. The app provides tools for game masters to organize campaign details, track player characters, and plan upcoming sessions.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 15+ with App Router and React 19+
- TypeScript for type safety
- Material UI v7 for UI components
- Zustand for state management (with React 19 compatibility solutions)

## Technical Requirements & Constraints
- The application must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Code must follow TypeScript best practices for type safety.
- Material UI v7 integration requires special handling:
  - Use `@mui/material-nextjs/v15-appRouter` package for Next.js 15 integration
  - Replace Lab components with custom implementations due to compatibility issues
  - Handle Grid component changes (remove deprecated props like `item`, `xs`, `sm`, `md`, etc.)
- Next.js 15 / React 19 considerations:
  - Dynamic route parameters must be unwrapped with `React.use()` before accessing
  - Zustand state selectors should be memoized or use mock data for rendering
  - Ensure all components are properly marked with 'use client' directive where needed
- Consider performance optimization for loading large datasets.
